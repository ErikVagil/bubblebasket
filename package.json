  "description": "Have you ever wanted to be more organized in life? Maybe one day you decided to draw up a list before you went shopping--a boring, bullet-pointed, unorganized piece of scratch paper that you no doubt forgot about the minute you got to the store. Instead of dealing with all of the hassle, try using the ShoppingTree app! Featuring a tidy and modern layout of bubbles representing different categories and items, adding something to your list is just a few simple clicks or taps away. Once you add something to your list, it's tied to your account, meaning you can access it from anywhere just by signing into ShoppingTree. Add things to your automatically organized list as needed, and check them off as you put them in your cart. Once you checkout, just clear your list for your next shopping trip.",
