# startup
Have you ever wanted to be more organized in life? Maybe one day you decided to draw up a list before you went shopping--a boring, bullet-pointed, unorganized piece of scratch paper that you no doubt forgot about the minute you got to the store. Instead of dealing with all of the hassle, try using the ShoppingTree app! Featuring a tidy and modern layout of bubbles representing different categories and items, adding something to your list is just a few simple clicks or taps away. Once you add something to your list, it's tied to your account, meaning you can access it from anywhere just by signing into ShoppingTree. Add things to your automatically organized list as needed, and check them off as you put them in your cart. Once you checkout, just clear your list for your next shopping trip.

### What I want to remember from the suite of JavaScript assignments
 - Arrow functions are just lambdas
 - Arrays are like Python lists but called arrays
 - Array push and pop functions work like a stack, not a queue
 - Anonymous functions have to be used to pass a function as a variable
 

### What I want to remember from Simon-CSS
 - One of the biggest issues I had was with things not resizing properly. Resizing mainly happens in `body`, `@media`, and any relevant `div` blocks
 - The Bootstrap docs are very helpful! They show syntax and different possible options and components. Also good for debugging
 - Ideally, I should figure out and write out the `header`/`footer`/any repetitive elements so I don't have to rewrite them multiple times if there's an issue down the line
 - Using `span` tags is great for isolating and phrasing chunks of elements for styling
