# startup
Have you ever wanted to be more organized in life? Maybe one day you decided to draw up a list before you went shopping--a boring, bullet-pointed, unorganized piece of scratch paper that you no doubt forgot about the minute you got to the store. Instead of dealing with all of the hassle, try using the ShoppingTree app! Featuring a tidy and modern layout of bubbles representing different categories and items, adding something to your list is just a few simple clicks or taps away. Once you add something to your list, it's tied to your account, meaning you can access it from anywhere just by signing into ShoppingTree. Add things to your automatically organized list as needed, and check them off as you put them in your cart. Once you checkout, just clear your list for your next shopping trip.

### What I learned from making my startup HTML and CSS
 - I got a lot better at using the flex property, which I'm really happy about. A tip I want to remember is that the flex property is that of the parent div, not always the individual. That tripped me up a bit doing this project. It's a lot of trial and error
 - Making the header and setting up the page before using it as a template saved me a lot of time
 - I learned how to import and use Bootstrap icons on my website to make it look good
 - Variables! It's nice to have a variable representing something at the top of the CSS file and use it throughout the stylesheet--that way if I need to change it, I only need to change it once
 - I'm definitely not done with the layout of the project. There's a lot of stuff I want to polish and add, so I'm going to work on it some more after this assignment. This was just a template/the bare minimum

### What I learned from making my startup JavaScript
 - Using the browser developer tools is really great for squashing bugs and finding problems that aren't manifesting themselves
 - Know what the return value of functions is \(like if it returns a number, array, object, etc\)! That'll help avoid mistakes and bugs
 - Make code that's as reusable as possible and add parameters in the onclick HTML event

### What I want to remember from the suite of JavaScript assignments
 - Arrow functions are just lambdas
 - Arrays are like Python lists but called arrays
 - Array push and pop functions work like a stack, not a queue
 - Anonymous functions have to be used to pass a function as a variable
 

### What I want to remember from Simon-CSS
 - One of the biggest issues I had was with things not resizing properly. Resizing mainly happens in `body`, `@media`, and any relevant `div` blocks
 - The Bootstrap docs are very helpful! They show syntax and different possible options and components. Also good for debugging
 - Ideally, I should figure out and write out the `header`/`footer`/any repetitive elements so I don't have to rewrite them multiple times if there's an issue down the line
 - Using `span` tags is great for isolating and phrasing chunks of elements for styling

### What I want to remember from Simon-Javascript
 - Make sure to link the elements in the HTML files to the functions/objects in the JavaScript file
 - Use localStorage to save and load using cookies
 - The ternary operator ?? is really convenient for making code concise
 - Partitioning code into classes makes for easy and reusable code
